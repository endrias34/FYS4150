To reproduce our results from the report, use  
makefile for compiling. Commenting (or uncommenting) the  
program you want to run.  
  
For easy execution of the different compiled codes, we encourage you to use run_script.sh,  
which is a shell script. (If you have not used a shell  
script before this it just means you could actually copy  
the code from the run_script.sh and paste it in the  
command line window) 

For plotting, use the ipython notebook.  
Remeber to change the directory of the textfiles.
