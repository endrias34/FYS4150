To reproduce our results from the report, use  
makefile for compiling. Commenting out or in the  
program you want to run.  
  
Then for easy execution of different variables in the  
compiled code, we encourage you to use run_script.sh  
which is a shell script. (If you have not used a shell  
script before this just means you could actually copy  
the code from the run_script.sh and paste it in the  
command line window) 

The for plotting, use the ipython note book.  
Remeber to change the directory of the textfile.
