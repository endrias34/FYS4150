[Codes](https://github.com/endrias34/FYS4150/tree/master/src/Project-3)
  

Simulation of the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, in that order from the center.  
The angle is choosen in such a way that we observe as many planets as possible in this time interval,  
which makes the orbits look a bit weird. They still orbits in the same plane, and we encourage  
you to download 3d_simulation.zip from the codes and dragging the angle around as you wish. You will then  
be able to see Uranus and Neptune also. If you are a bit familiar with python plotting, you can also turn  
the axis on, to see the plane better. In this gif you will after a while see Pluto at the top,  
which actually orbit in a different plane. The planet sizes is a heuristics approximations.
